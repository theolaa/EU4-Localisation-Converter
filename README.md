## EU4 Localisation Generator
This tool allows you to write localisation for you EU4 mod in whichever language you choose, and then convert those loc files into the other three languages. This allows players to play your mod in their native language, without having tons of missing localisation everywhere.

**NOTE:** This tool does NOT translate your text! It only creates the loc files for the other languages with the text that you've already written.

**Download:** [latest version](https://github.com/theolaa/EU4-Localisation-Converter/releases/tag/v0.3-alpha) | [old versions](https://github.com/theolaa/EU4-Localisation-Converter/releases)
